# Tutorial 3.2: Adaptive Binning and HDF5 Storage of Coordinates: 1-Butanol Membrane Permation
This tutorial is meant to demonstrate how to set up, run, and analyze a membrane permeation simulation using WESTPA and the minimal adaptive binning (MAB) scheme.

## Tutorial files

All files necessary for completing the tutorial can be found in this directory.
Please install required packages before running the tutorial by running the following command:
```
